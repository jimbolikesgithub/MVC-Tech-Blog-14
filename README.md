# MVC-Tech-Blog-14

--- This challenge presented its dev with many challenges. Building a full-stack website
is no easy task. I plan on building a website that works properly. I am still learning,
but I believe I will get this down pat soon. I do enjoy building things, though, I'd rather
create something I enjoy for the next one. ---
